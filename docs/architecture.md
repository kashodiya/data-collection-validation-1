This document provides an overview of the Federal Reserve Data Collection System architecture.

## System Overview

The Federal Reserve Data Collection System is a web-based application that allows financial institutions to submit regulatory reports to the Federal Reserve. The system manages MDRM (Micro Data Reference Manual) data elements, validates submissions using configurable rules, and supports multiple report series with flexible data formats.

## Component Details

### Frontend (React)

The frontend is built using React and provides a user interface for interacting with the system. It includes the following components:

- **Authentication**: Login and user management
- **Dashboard**: Overview of submissions and system status
- **Institution Management**: Registration and management of financial institutions
- **Data Submission**: Upload and management of regulatory reports
- **Validation**: Display of validation results and error correction
- **Report Generation**: Generation of reports and data visualization
- **Form Management**: Access to forms and instructions

### Backend (FastAPI)

The backend is built using FastAPI and provides a RESTful API for the frontend to interact with. It includes the following components:

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication and authorization
- **API Endpoints**: RESTful API endpoints for all system functionality
- **Data Processing**: Processing of uploaded data files
- **Validation Engine**: Execution of validation rules
- **Report Generation**: Generation of reports and data exports
- **File Management**: Storage and retrieval of forms and instructions

### Database (SQLite)

The database stores all system data, including:

- **Institutions**: Information about financial institutions
- **MDRM Items**: Data elements from the Micro Data Reference Manual
- **Report Series**: Information about report series
- **Data Submissions**: Submitted reports and their status
- **Submitted Data**: Actual data values submitted
- **Validation Rules**: Rules for validating submitted data
- **Validation Results**: Results of validation rule execution
- **Users**: User accounts and authentication information

## Data Flow

1. **Authentication**: Users authenticate with the system using their username and password.
2. **Data Submission**: Financial institutions upload data files in various formats (CSV, Excel, XML, JSON).
3. **Data Processing**: The backend processes the uploaded files and extracts the data.
4. **Data Validation**: The validation engine executes validation rules against the submitted data.
5. **Error Correction**: Users correct any errors identified during validation.
6. **Report Generation**: Users generate reports based on the submitted data.
7. **Data Export**: Users export data in various formats (CSV, Excel, PDF).

## Security

The system implements the following security measures:

- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with password hashing
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Input Validation**: Validation of all user inputs
- **File Validation**: Validation of uploaded files
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling and logging
- **CORS Protection**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing protection
- **CSRF Protection**: Cross-Site Request Forgery protection

## Deployment

The system is designed to be deployed as a single server application with the following components:

- **Web Server**: Serves the frontend and backend
- **Database**: SQLite database file
- **File Storage**: Local file storage for uploads, forms, and instructions

## Scalability

The system is designed to handle a moderate load of concurrent users and submissions. For higher loads, the following scalability options are available:

- **Database**: Replace SQLite with a more scalable database like PostgreSQL
- **File Storage**: Replace local file storage with a cloud storage solution
- **Web Server**: Deploy multiple instances behind a load balancer

## Monitoring and Logging

The system includes the following monitoring and logging capabilities:

- **Application Logs**: Logs of application events and errors
- **User Activity Logs**: Logs of user actions
- **System Metrics**: Metrics on system performance and usage
- **Health Checks**: Endpoints for checking system health
